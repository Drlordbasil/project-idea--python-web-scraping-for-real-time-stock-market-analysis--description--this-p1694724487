## Project Description
This Python project aims to leverage web scraping techniques and libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Google Python to collect real-time stock market data and perform analysis to aid in investment decisions. The project will automate the process of data gathering and analysis without relying on local files, ensuring the latest information is always utilized.

## Features
1. **Web Scraping**: Use BeautifulSoup to scrape real-time stock market data from reputable financial websites, such as Yahoo Finance or Google Finance. Extract key data points like stock prices, volume, company news, and financial performance metrics.

2. **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Validate the scraped data for accuracy and completeness. Clean the data by removing any irrelevant or redundant information, ensuring only reliable and essential data is used for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**: Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize the collected data through charts, graphs, and trends. Display stock price histories, volume trends, moving averages, and other relevant visualizations to help users analyze the stock's performance.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment analysis, to assess market sentiment regarding specific stocks. Utilize libraries like NLTK or TextBlob to analyze news articles, social media posts, or earnings call transcripts to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

5. **Technical Indicators**: Calculate and visualize popular technical indicators, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands. These indicators can provide insights into stock trends, volatility, and potential buy or sell signals.

6. **Investment Strategies**: Develop and implement various investment strategies based on technical indicators and sentiment analysis. For example, users could backtest a strategy that buys stocks when the RSI indicator is oversold or sells when the sentiment turns negative. Provide visual representations of strategy performance and metrics.

7. **Real-time Notifications**: Utilize messaging or email APIs to send users real-time notifications when specific events, such as significant price movements, occur or when specific technical indicators trigger buy/sell signals.

8. **Portfolio Tracking**: Allow users to input their portfolio holdings and track performance over time. Calculate and visualize portfolio returns, compare against market benchmarks, and provide risk metrics such as standard deviation or portfolio beta.

By developing a Python script that can scrape real-time stock market data, perform analysis, and provide actionable insights, investors can make informed decisions based on the latest information. This project eliminates the need for users to rely on local files and ensures the program can access the necessary data and tools directly from the web, resulting in more accurate and up-to-date analytics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Import the required libraries:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
```

2. Set up the `StockData` class with the desired stock symbol:
```python
class StockData:
    def __init__(self, stock_symbol):
        self.stock_symbol = stock_symbol

    def get_stock_data(self):
        # Web scraping code to retrieve stock data
        pass
```

3. Create instances of the `StockData` class for the desired stocks:
```python
stock_symbols = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT']
stocks = [StockData(symbol) for symbol in stock_symbols]
```

4. Set up the `PortfolioTracker` class with the list of stocks and initial investment:
```python
class PortfolioTracker:
    def __init__(self, stocks, initial_investment):
        self.stocks = stocks
        self.initial_investment = initial_investment
        self.portfolio_returns = pd.DataFrame()

    def track_portfolio(self):
        # Portfolio tracking code
        pass

    def visualize_returns(self):
        # Visualization code
        pass
```

5. Create an instance of the `PortfolioTracker` class and track the portfolio:
```python
portfolio_tracker = PortfolioTracker(stocks, 100000)
portfolio_returns = portfolio_tracker.track_portfolio()
```

6. Visualize the portfolio returns:
```python
portfolio_tracker.visualize_returns()
```

7. Set up the `NotificationSystem` class with email credentials:
```python
class NotificationSystem:
    def __init__(self, email_address, email_password):
        self.email_address = email_address
        self.email_password = email_password

    def send_email_notification(self, recipient_email, subject, message):
        # Email notification code
        pass

    def send_sms_notification(self, phone_number, message):
        # SMS notification code
        pass
```

8. Create an instance of the `NotificationSystem` class and send notifications:
```python
notification_system = NotificationSystem('your_email@gmail.com', 'email_password')
notification_system.send_email_notification('recipient_email@gmail.com', 'Stock Market Update',
                                             'Your portfolio has performed well.')
notification_system.send_sms_notification('phone_number', 'Your portfolio has performed well.')
```
